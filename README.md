/*Idea Description*/
To facilitate the connection between the civil agencies and civilians, we propose a social media like application where the users can report a pothole by taking a picture of the pothole and providing a suitable landmark. More suitable information will be automatically collected using various _ of the device. This info will include:
1. An accurate location of the pothole(~10m).
2. Reverse geocode of the location, so that the region of the pothole can be known.
3. The image uploaded by the user will be run through an Image Labeler, which will label the objects present in the image using Machine Vision. This will ensure that no irrelevant images of the pothole are submitted and will reduce human workload.

We plan a web/phone interface for the administrators. This will include features such as:
1. Region wise reports for different regional admins.
2. Ability to control the status of a report.
2. Highly informative maps with visual representation of the data.
3. Feedback from users.

Innovative Features:

1. Automatic pothole detection using accelerometer of the device.
2. Detection of best path with least no of potholes.
3. Sharing of reports through Social Media, which will help in promotion and outreach of the application.
4. Accidental Emergencies.
5. Feed of all the reports submitted which can be classified according to location, time or dangerous.

Leaderboard:
We propose a leaderboard system, where in virtual points are given to the users when a report is submitted, approved and completed. The leaderboard will highlight the users with most points and special prizes or rewards can be provided to the users. The users can earn various badges according to their activity.
